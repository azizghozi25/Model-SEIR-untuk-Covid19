# Model-SEIR-untuk-Covid19
I made this project for an event from HIMATIKA ITERA named "Python Software Training" which was held on 30 Oktober 2020. It is an honor for me to be asked to fill in as a presenter. I present about how using pyhton in modelling mathematics, specifically I presented about Model SEIR for COVID19. If you are interested what I presented, here is drop link https://youtu.be/EqQ6Fg0BSHw.  

### What is the content  about ?
- Simple Model SEIR for COVID19

Basically this model is derived from ordinary differential equations, so i tried to explain how solve this model using : 
    
    1. Numerical Method with Finite Different Method.
    
    2. tools solver ODE such as odeint from library scipy.integrate.

After get the result, I tried to explain how to make dataframe from the result and how to plot the result with slider in order to make visualization more interactive. 
 
- Complex Model SEIR for COVID19 

Because the complexity, we don't use numerical method manually but we use odeint in order to get the process quckly and easily. After get the result, I tried to explain how to make dataframe from the result and how to plot the result with slider in order to make visualization more interactive.
